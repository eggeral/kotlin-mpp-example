# Kotlin Mutliplatfom Example

This tutorial guides you through the steps of creating a multi-platform Kotlin application. 
Starting from two separate projects, one for iOS and one for Android, we will create a non-trivial 
app which with share Kotlin code. 

We will then extend the scope of the app even further and create a web application, and a JavaFX 
application using the same shared source as for Android and iOS.

Follow the branches from starting from step001 to see the project evolving.
